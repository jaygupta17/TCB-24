                            More than 78% of people in the world own a smartphone. What are people doing with these gadgets? They make use of apps. App development is similar to other types of software development, such as web apps. The ability of mobile apps to exploit native capabilities on a device is the most significant difference between app development and traditional software development. We have app development enthusiasts, and we aim to grow this community of enthusiastic app developers!
